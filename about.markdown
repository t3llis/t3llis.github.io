I am focused on Red Team operations and Network Penetration Testing as well as Web Application Security while i enjoy making things OPSEC.


This blog will be about sharing learning experiences, projects and personal research in my spare time. Feel free to reach out to me with some valuable feedback and fresh ideas!


Enjoy,

Charis
